# The Internet Explained

## What is the internet?

The internet is the world’s most popular computer network. It began as an academic research project in 1969, and became a global commercial network in the 1990s. Today it is used by more than 2 billion people around the world.

인터넷은 세상에서 가장 유명한 컴퓨터 네트워크임. 1969년에 학술 검색 프로젝트로 시작하여, 1990년에 글로벌한 상업 네트워크로 활성화됨. 요즘에는 전 세계적으로 대략 20억 명이 넘는 사람들이 이용중.

* commercial = 상업의, 상업적인

The internet is notable for its decentralization. No one owns the internet or controls who can connect to it. Instead, thousands of different organizations operate their own networks and negotiate voluntary interconnection agreements.



Most people access internet content using a web browser. Indeed, the web has become so popular that many people incorrectly treat the internet and the web as synonymous. But in reality, the web is just one of many internet applications. Other popular Internet applications include email and BitTorrent.
